# PROGETTO ACTAM

## INTRODUCTION
The main goal of our project is to implement a multifunctional system wich is able to give to the executor a creative tool for music production and live sessions, just using his laptop.

## SECTIONS
Our system is carachterised by three main sections:

## Recorder
This allows the executor to record his voice or an instrument through the mic input. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99413338/153432794-0ae2fb83-6d11-425a-a3ce-8d7c38b9004a.png)

Starting from the lower buttons, the ON/OFF  switcher activate the recorder, and the REC button allows you to start and stop the recording whenever you want.

Then you can select a section of our recording trough the two knobs implemented in the middle section: 
with the upper one you can choose where the section starts, and with the lower one where the section ends.

If you  want to hear what you have selected trough the knobs, there is a button TEST that allows you to do that.

On the upper section, there is a granular tool where, pressing the RND button and selecting the random speed with a slider, the system starts playing some random sections of the recording, that have the same length of the main section and that change with the selected velocity.

## Synth
In this section a polyphonic synth is implemented.

In the lower section, there is  keyboard and some buttons:

the ON/OFF, the octave selector, where pressing + or – you can go up or down by an octave, and the switcher TALK/PLAY:  when the switcher is set on PLAY, the keyboard works for the synth section, but when is set to TALK, the keyboard becomes a pitch modulator for the recorder explained before.

In the middle section there are two different tools: 
On the left, there is a waveshape selector, where you can choose the shape of your soundwave between: sine, triangular, square or sawtooth.

On the right side there is the envelopes secition, where you can set the attack, sustain, decay, release and the main gain of the notes. There is also a canvas where you can directly visualize the final result.

On the upper section there is a canvas where you can see the final wave emitted by the synth.

In this section some effects for the synth are implemented: starting from the left, there is a filters section, divided in low-pass and high-pass,  an echo section, where you can set the delay and the gain, and a frequency difference section, where you can set the detune value.
All these function are implemented with some sliders. 
There is also a window on the left where you can select some presets for the evelopes and  the effects.
